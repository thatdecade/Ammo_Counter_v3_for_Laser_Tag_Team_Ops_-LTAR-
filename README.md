# Ammo Counter for Laser Tag Team Ops (ZZLT)
This is my third attempt at making an Ammo Counter for the LTAR tagger.  This version connects to the LTAR's headphone jack to receive game data.  It was designed in collaboration with Ryan Bales.

The advantages of the ZZLT LTAR Display over the v2 LTAR Number Display are numerous.
- Bar graph indicator to match previous generation LTX displays
- Leverages the LTAR headphone jack to be compatible with all game modes!!!
- Lower power requirements
- Designed to match contours of LTAR iron sight
- Advanced modes to find player number in hosted games
- Easier installation, just 4 wires.
